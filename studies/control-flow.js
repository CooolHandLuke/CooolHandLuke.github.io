/**CONTROL FLOW
*-control flow is order that the instructions and statements in the code are executed.
* 
*-There are many control structures, like functions, loops and conditionals.  
* 
*-These statements take values and moves them through a block of code which directs what happens and dictates the outcome.
* 
*-a good example of control flow is and if/else-if statement.  Beginning with the first if statement, 
*   and it evaluates to true, the flow stops and returns.  If false, it moves on to be evaluated by the else if statement, 
*   and stops if true, and continues if false, and moves to the next if/else. If none of them are true you move to an 
*   else statement and end the code block.
*
* 
* Think of it as going to the grocery store to look for coffee. You look down the first aisle (if) and continue 
*   down each aisle in trun (else/if) if itâ€™s not there. If there is no coffee (else) you leave the store under-caffienated
